# Timeseries DBs - Comparison 

This project evaluates the performance of TimescaleDB and InfluxDB, two leading time series databases, using the TSBS benchmark on self-generated data and a custom benchmark on a real-world medical sensor dataset. Time series data, crucial in fields like finance, climate science, and healthcare, presents unique challenges such as temporal dependencies, irregular frequencies, and data noise. TimescaleDB, built on PostgreSQL, offers SQL-based analytics with time series optimizations, while InfluxDB, designed for high-throughput ingestion, excels in real-time monitoring.
